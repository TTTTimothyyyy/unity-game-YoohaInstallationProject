# unity-game-YoohaInstallationProject
A free of charge game I made for a client as part of their university art installation project in Amsterdam. I was given instructions for design, story, flow and media. All the rest was left to my creativity and programming ability.

Mechanics Instruction:
- To build a game where the player is given the allusion of choice during choice based dialogue gameplay.
- To make the player feel like they are in control of their relationship with the NPC "Yooha".
- To evoke a sense of insecurity when the player figures out that they dodged a bullet so to say, by avoiding "Yooha" at the end.

Game Flow:
1. The player sees the dating app swipe and is immediately matched with "Yooha".
2. The Player engages with "Yooha" in some small talk and they plan a date.
3. The player and "Yooha" go on their date and chat.
4. The player and "Yooha's" dating app chat dies down and the game switches to "Yooha's" perspective who starts to throw a tantrum by spamming the chat with messages, but gets no responses from the Player...
5. The game ends there leaving the Person playing the game with feelings of shock, confusion, and fear.

Design and Style:
- Inspired by Doku Doku Literature Club.
- Inspired by Yanderi Simulator.
- Bitter sweat.
